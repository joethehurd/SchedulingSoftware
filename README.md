Scheduling Software is a business/productivity app that enables users to manage customers and global business scheduling processes. 
Key features enable users to log in and out, generate and filter reports, and add, update, and delete customer records and appointments. 
The app automatically determines the userâ€™s location and dynamically adjusts language and time while considering time zones and daylight-savings. 
Appointment types are captured with a link to the associated customer record in the database, user activity is tracked and logged, and the user is notified of upcoming appointments.
